## Introduction
This project proposes a generalized framework for recognizing and
understanding the expiration date of product packages. The proposed
framework can handle challenging expiration date cases and distinguish
13 different date formats. Moreover, it can accurately detect and
recognize expiration dates even when the input image contains multiple
dates. It generates bounding boxes with predictions in the image.

## Executable files
We've released **[executable files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ch6pOgzInlGOOo3OHyMNJ-OUiHLSF623?usp=sharing) of the proposed framework. Anyone
who would like to test their own images for recognition and
understanding the expiration date can use our **[executable file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ch6pOgzInlGOOo3OHyMNJ-OUiHLSF623?usp=sharing). 


## Dataset
In the lack of a publicly available dataset, we create a novel dataset,
ExpDate, consisting of 1767 real-world images with expiration dates. It
is now publicly available for further research.
