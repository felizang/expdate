## Introduction
This project proposes a generalized framework for detecting and
understanding the expiration date of the products. The proposed
framework can handle challenging expiration date cases and distinguish
13 different date formats. Moreover, it can detect and
recognize expiration dates even when the input image contains multiple
dates. It generates bounding boxes with predictions in the image.

## Executable files
We've released executable files of the proposed framework. Anyone
who would like to test their images for recognition and
understanding the expiration date can use our demo file. 


## Dataset
In the lack of a publicly available dataset, we create a novel dataset,
ExpDate, consisting of date images with challenging cases. It
is now publicly available for further research.  


## Details
Please check the **[project page](https://felizang.github.io/expdate/)** for
more details about executable files and the dataset.
